YOU ARE BUILDING A RUNELITE PLUGIN TO SYNC PLAYER DATA WITH OUR BACKEND SERVER TO PROVIDE USERS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THEIR BANK, MERCHABLE ITEMS, AND PROVIDE PRICE ANALYSTICS AND OTHER INFO USING OUR BACKEND, ALL PRESENTED TO THE USER ON OUR FRONTEND 


READ THE DOCS THEY CONTAIN ALL UPDATED DOCUMENTATION:
@plugin/docs
- runelite-api gives you access to the raw game state.
- runelite-client builds on top of that and gives you plugin tools, lifecycle management, overlays, event listeners, etc.
- ask the user for more details

BACKEND README: backend/README.md
FRONTEND README: frontend/README.md

we need to use Java 11 to build the Runelite plugin - you're on mac terminal so use jenv - run the build and the user can test the plugin directly through intellij - API token is already in place and confirmed syncing with backend

@runelite contains the github repo for Runelite
